# Blackjack
This ‘player vs computer’ program simulates a real blackjack game with random draws from the dealer and an additional advice bot that suggests the safest move to play (hit or stand).
Challenges and Solutions:
-	With guidance and help from my lecturer Steve James, creating a random deck for every game was challenging but do-able using static seeds, shuffle and draw methods .
-	Storing and manipulating the input data as in the card suit, number and in game value required choosing an appropriate data structure that could store all these aspects and compare like initializer lists, string vector and string integer pairs.
-	The mechanics/logic of playing the game whilst checking if a player is bust and keeping track of the player and dealer required the use of many methods passing pointers and previously mentioned data structures and variables
